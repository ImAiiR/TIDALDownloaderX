## About
TIDALDownloaderX is a simple C# program for downloading videos from the streaming platform <a href="https://tidal.com/">TIDAL</a>.

TIDAL serves videos in segments of 2-10 second .ts files, all with the same string before (and occasionally, after) the numbered clip.

TIDALDownloaderX takes the first link that TIDAL sends to the user, and downloads the following .ts files, until it has completed downloading all .ts files relating to that video.
